# fetchgo

fetchgo is a minimal Go library designed to simplify HTTP requests across different runtimes. It provides a unified API that works in the browser with TinyGo + WebAssembly using syscall/js, and on the server using Goâ€™s standard net/http package. With fetchgo, you can write cross-platform HTTP logic once and run it anywhere.
